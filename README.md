# Glitch Hosted Sample Sticky Note Trello Power-Up ðŸš€

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Sticky Note is small Power-Up for Trello allowing you to stick a note to you cards to remember you or other people of important stuff.
It was born out of the request of colleagues from the company I am an intern in. After looking for such Power-Up, I noticed it didn't exist (or it was a paid service and you had to register an account...). My colleagues wanted simple and bright notes to stick on Trello cards so I did what I do best, develop.
